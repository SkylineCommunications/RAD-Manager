# Easily configure Relational Anomaly Detection and inspect its results

[Relational Anomaly Detection (RAD)](https://aka.dataminer.services/RAD) is a **powerful feature** that can detect when a group of parameters **deviates from its normal behavior**. It can be used **in many different scenarios** such as monitoring whether main and backup channels are in sync, checking whether load balancing is performing optimally, tracking health of battery cells, and much more.

This app allows you to **easily configure** relational anomaly detection and **visualize** its results.

> [!NOTE]
> DataMiner 10.5.11/10.6.0 or higher is only compatible with RAD Manager version 3.1.0 or higher. Using any older version of RAD Manager on this DataMiner server version might lead to unexpected behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> From version 3.0.0 onwards, the RAD Manager app requires the [GQI DxM](https://aka.dataminer.services/gqi-dxm). Make sure the GQI DxM is installed and enabled before installing the RAD Manager, or use RAD Manager version 2.0.4, if possible.
